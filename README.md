# Dure - Community App

## Why This Project Exists
Its attempt to providing distributed e-commerce experience for small shop owner.

---

## TL;DR

### The Problem
Today's e-commerce solutions are server-centric, which makes them attractive targets for hackers and increases security risk. A distributed store
 architecture addresses this vulnerability — though building such a service comes with its own challenges.

- **Hosting Store Front with Payment Gateway** require DNS Settings, Wasm Static Hosting, Web-DB like supabase, firebase supports
- **Managing Shared Stores** provide store managing features. Products, Orders, Shipments, Accounts, Dure(Shared) Managements.
- **Ecommerce Client** managing multiple store front client.

### The Solution
**dure** is a distributed ecommerce client/hosing with a single tool.

- **Identity Mgmt** : Private/Public Key for personal identity, Firebase/Supabase identity. Attestation WASM/EGUI Apps with github sigstore.
- **Guest Front with WASM** : Providing minimum Guest identity for customer. Listing Reviews. Messages. Stores. Carts.
- **Store Front with WASM (only for Service Providers)** : Listing Promotions, Products, Payments.
- **Hosting Mgmt with EGUI** : DNS (octodns), DB (Firebase, Supabase), Site (FB/SB CloudFunctions)
- **Store Mgmt with EGUI** : Managing Promotions, Products, Orders, Shipments, Accountings, Dure (Shared Listing, Shipments with other store)
- **Database** : Diesel ORM with embedded migrations (SQLite for all platforms, optional PostgreSQL for desktop)
- All operations are ready for modification by LLM.
- Diesel uses SQLite3MultipleCiphers backend for desktop, sqlite3 for diesel, postgresql for firebase or supabase.

### Usage

- Clients Type : CLI, GUI, WASM, MCP
- Server Type : GCP(Fully Automatic), Cafe24(SSH only), Firebase(RealtimeDB), Supabase

#### Start Service
```bash
# Create configuration file

# Run configuration Check
dure hosting check

# Run Initiating Process
dure hosting init
```

#### Start TRAY/GUI Guest Client (Desktop/Android/WASM)
```bash
# client tray mode
dure --tray 

# client gui mode without tray
dure --gui 
```
* Dure eGui Android App with [Android App Functions](https://developer.android.com/ai/appfunctions)

## Design Philosophy

### 1. Agent-First Design

Every command supports `--json` for AI coding agents:

```bash
dure list --json | jq '.issues[] | select(.priority <= 1)'
dure ready --json  # Structured output for agents
dure show bd-abc123 --json
```

For routine operator or agent use, prefer `RUST_LOG=error br ...` to suppress internal Rust dependency logs while preserving normal stdout/JSON output:

```bash
RUST_LOG=error dure ready --json
RUST_LOG=error dure sync --flush-only
```

### 2. Separate egui comonents with data preparation. and put some cache in between.

### 3. All api service and client is generate by ASYNCAPI generator. strictly controlled.

## Configuration

dure uses layered configuration:

1. **CLI flags** (highest priority)
2. **Environment variables**
3. **Project config**: `.dure/config.yaml`
4. **User config**: `~/.config/dure/config.yaml`
5. **Defaults** (lowest priority)

### Example Config

[embedmd]:# (mobile/config.example.yml)
```yml
# Dure Application Configuration
# platform | domain | server

# Platform identification
platform:
  name: "mylaptop"

# Domain and SSL certificate configuration
domain:
  # Primary domain name (will register both example.com and *.example.com)
  name: "example.com"
  
  # DNS provider: "cloudflare", "duckdns", "gcloud", or "porkbun"
  dns_provider: "cloudflare"
  
  # SSL certificate configuration
  cert:
    # Email for Let's Encrypt notifications
    email: "admin@example.com"
    # Certificate paths (auto-updated by 'dure acme issue')
    cert_path: ""
    key_path: ""
    issuer_path: ""
  
  # Cloudflare DNS credentials (if dns_provider = "cloudflare")
  cloudflare:
    # Option 1: Use API Token (recommended)
    api_token: "your_cloudflare_api_token_here"
    # Option 2: Use Email + API Key (legacy)
    # email: "you@example.com"
    # api_key: "your_cloudflare_api_key_here"
  
  # DuckDNS credentials (if dns_provider = "duckdns")
  duckdns:
    token: ""
  
  # Google Cloud DNS credentials (if dns_provider = "gcloud")
  # Option 1: Using service account file only
  #   GCE_PROJECT + GCE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE
  # Option 2: Using default credentials with impersonation
  #   GCE_PROJECT + GCE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
  # Option 3: Using service account file with impersonation
  #   GCE_PROJECT + GCE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_FILE + GCE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT
  gcloud:
    project: ""  # Required for all options
    service_account_file: ""  # Optional: path to service account JSON file
    impersonate_service_account: ""  # Optional: target service account email to impersonate
  
  # Porkbun DNS credentials (if dns_provider = "porkbun")
  porkbun:
    api_key: ""
    secret_api_key: ""

# Server hosting configuration
server:
  # Web hosting: "GCE", "VPS", "CLOUDFLARE_PAGES", or "FIREBASE_HOSTING"
  web_provider: "GCE"
  web_provider_token: ""
  # Database: "GCE", "GCP_CLOUDSQL", or "SUPABASE"
  db_provider: "GCE"

```

### Config Commands

```bash
# Show all config
dure config list

# Get specific value
dure config get id.prefix

# Set value
dure config set defaults.priority=1

# Open in editor
dure config edit
```

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DURE_DB` / `DURE_DATABASE` | Override database path |
| `DURE_JSONL` | Override JSONL path (requires `--allow-external-jsonl`) |
| `RUST_LOG` | Logging level (debug, info, warn, error) |

Recommended default for normal CLI use:

```bash
export RUST_LOG=error
```

This keeps successful commands readable by suppressing low-level dependency logging. Remove or override it when debugging `dure` internals.

### Safety Model

dure is designed to be **provably safe**:

| Guarantee | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| Atomic writes | Write to temp file, then rename |
| No data loss | Guards prevent overwriting non-empty JSONL with empty DB |

## Troubleshooting

## Limitations
dure intentionally does **not** support:

## FAQ

## AI Agent Integration

dure is designed for AI coding agents. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for:

- JSON output schemas
- Workflow patterns
- Integration with MCP Agent Mail
- Robot mode flags
- Best practices

You can also emit machine-readable JSON Schema documents directly:

```bash
dure schema all --format json | jq '.schemas.Issue'
dure schema issue-details --format toon
```
